# JS_card_game

A game inspired by Across the Obelisk, Slay the Spire, and other roguelite card games.

# Early stages of prototyping

Everything is temporary while Working on getting the systems that need to communicate with each other, to communicate with each other. Along the way, making some simple UI to help troubleshoot and visualize the systems.

# Refactor pass

Once everything seems to be in place I will make, probably a few, refactor passes to reduce redundant code, clean up the workspace, and organize to make the code more readable. I will probably do some refactoring during the prototyping but just to help the systems interact to my liking.

# UI pass

Gotta make it look good. But this is low priority until near completion. There maybe be some exceptions to help visualize systems.
